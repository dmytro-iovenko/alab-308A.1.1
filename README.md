## ALAB 308A.1.1: Practical Use of the Event Loop
This assignment will introduce some practical implementations of event loop and call stack concepts, as well as emphasize some of the common issues a JavaScript developer may run into due to the implementation of these core features.
## Objectives
- Calculate the maximum size of the JavaScript call stack.
- Use "trampolines" to handle stack overflow issues caused by recursion.
- Use deferred execution within the event loop to allow the browser to render between calculations.
